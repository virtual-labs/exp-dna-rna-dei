### Aim

The determination of the quality of nucleic acid (free from protein contamination or RNA/DNA contamination) and accurate concentration of nucleic acid is important for downstream applications.  Techniques like transfection, cloning, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS), all require high-quality nucleic acid. These applications often have a specific target; a nanogram range of nucleic acid concentration for optimal performance. Inaccurate quantification can increase variability in downstream assays and affect the quality of results.
